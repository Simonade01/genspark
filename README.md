# 🌟 Genspark

My first web project — part of my growing portfolio in web development.

## 👋 About

**Genspark** is my first hands-on experiment using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to create an interactive personal webpage.  
This project helped me understand the structure of web pages, how styling works, and how to make them come alive with simple interactivity.

## 🚀 Features

- Responsive layout that adjusts to different screen sizes  
- Simple hover and click animations  
- A personal greeting button that interacts with users  
- Custom colors and fonts styled through CSS  

## 💻 Built With

- **HTML5** — for structure  
- **CSS3** — for design and layout  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** — for interactivity  
- **Visual Studio Code** — for development
